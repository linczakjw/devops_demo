    <h1>Docker Setup</h1>
      <p>There are plenty of tutorials on setting up and learning Docker and containers.
         One thing that keeps coming up: what is a container and how does it differ from a VM? Well,
         <a href="https://youtu.be/8fi7uSYlOdc">this video</a> linked directly in Docker's docs was
         really enlightening to me, especially if you have a general understanding of UNIX/Linux systems.
         In essence, if you can narrow down the environment that you need to maintain for your application
         to only the absolute bare needs of the OS and any packages or frameworks and nothing else, and
         have it so that the container can still share the resources of a physical machine and its OS without
         being able to talk to anything else that may be running on the machine, then containers are
         exactly what you need.</p>
      <p>A side note: I've never read or even know if any docs on this level of detail exist, but I would
         imagine that Apple is essentially using containerization for all of their apps on iOS devices.
         This allows for the app to not have access to other containers ("apps") running on the device unless
         explicitly allowed in the default setup of system OS tie-ins, etc, and if you were able to somehow
         escape to a shell within the app, the root wouldn't be the root to the underlying OS, but a frameworks
         root only for your container app, keeping things secure.  OK, ending digression.</p>

      <h2>How We're Going to Start</h2>
        <p>Basically, without getting into too much of the philosophy of things right now, we'll Start
           by shortcutting our application and downloading an existing docker image that has been setup as
           a microservice for processing images, so the first thing is to get Docker desktop and then
           grab the docker image for this microservice and run it.
        </p>

      <h2>Download and install Docker</h2>
        <p>I'm on a 10-year old iMac where I can't go any higher than Catalina for the OS install (fun!).
           And while things are a little slow, everything still works.  All of my examples will be on the
           Mac, but you can do this on Windows as well.</p>
        
        <ul>
           <li>Download Docker: <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop</a></li>
           <li>Install Docker by following the prompts in the installer</li>
           <li>Helpful: sign up for a Docker Hub account - and for crying out loud, use MFA and store your creds in 1Password or something similar!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's it for now!  But...</p>

      <h2>A small (maybe) diversion on security and development workflows</h2>
        <p>I haven't done a ton of research on this from a security perspective.  What's great about containers (and VMs like those spun up from Vagrant)
           is that at least by default they are exposed only to the host machine.  But of course the assumption is that the host machine you are working
           on is secure, and that's likely a poor assumption.  Here are some things I would consider in a setup, and I would be curious what other people think about this, especially
           if you are in a place where you work on code for multiple clients:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Rather than running all of your containers and developing right off of your user account on your Mac's OS, setup a separate
              virtual machine running on your Mac (or, frankly, get another machine for development purposes only) and use that for all development (perhaps one VM per client if that's your workflow).
              The VM could be created and managed in this way:
              <ol>
                <li>Install Vagrant on your Mac and setup vagrantfile configs for each of the VMs/boxes you want to run for development when you need them</li>
                <li>Install Ansible or a similar tool on your Mac so that you can use it with Vagrant to script and spec the VMs you would like with all
                  the necessary tools and software packages you would like to have.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the default settings of sharing vagrant fileshares between your Mac and your VMs if they aren't needed</li>
                <li>Lock down networking on the VM/boxes.  By default, Vagrant creates a default vagrant account for SSH access to your box, but the default password is 'vagrant', and the SSH key is insecure.
                  So would likely the root account.  You can fix this in a variety of ways and re-save as your new default private box.</li>
                <li>Keep your vagrantfile configs and Ansible configs in source control (per client if need be) so you can rebuild them at any time</li>
                <li>More extreme: if you have a router that you can configure with multiple VLANs, set up one for each client's VMs you are working on and
                  make it so that you can only get to that VLAN via VPN setup.  Then make sure in your vagrant box that they are assigned the VLAN IDs you
                  created, so at the least (if you want) multiple VMs/boxes on that VLAN can talk to each other in whatever way you wish, but nothing else.
                </li>
                <li>With a VM ready for use for development, you can setup containers on those VMs, your software, whatever you wish.</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>I've not setup anything yet from the above, but with some quick work you can probably make that happen.  I could see integrating, say,
           with 1Password's Secrets Automation if you or your company or team use 1Password so that the default passwords for the accounts setup
           with Vagrant can be available only to the team or teams that needs them.
        </p>
