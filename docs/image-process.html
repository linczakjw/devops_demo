    <h1>Image Processing Docker container</h1>
      <p>OK, I picked image processing as an example solely because it was something that most likely you may do a tiny bit
         of (uploading and changing an avatar, for example) but generally don't want to spin your wheels building something
         on your own when you have a ton of other things to do.  So, I'm pulling from a docker image someone already
         created that handles image processing: h2non's imaginary Docker image and microservice.  You can find documentation
         here on getting the Docker image: <a href="https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#docker">https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#docker</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Yes, this container is utterly overkill for what we need, but it's simple and fast, and this is a throw-away project anyway, right?</p>

      <p>Open your terminal and run this command:</p>
        <code>
          docker pull h2non/imaginary
        </code>

      <p>Before we start the container, we're just going to leave everything default, which means, according to the documentation, port 9000
         on localhost is where the service will be, and imaginary also exposes a form at http://localhost:9000/form if you want to start
         messing around with what imaginary can do, so that's what we'll start with.  Later on, we'll build our own form in Spring Boot
         to post REST calls to imaginary's service so that we can get the results that way.  To start the container:
      </p>
        <code>
          docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 h2non/imaginary
        </code>

      <p>If you don't add the <code>-p 9000:9000</code>, the port in the container will be open to listening, but your OS will not open
         port 9000 to send traffic to the listening port on the container. Running the <code>docker run</code> command will leave an open
         process in your terminal - just keep it like that for now, then open up a browser and head to <a href="http://localhost:9000/form">http://localhost:9000/form</a>.
         The form should appear and look like this:</p>

      <img src="images/default_form.png" alt="Default imaginary form for testing services">

      <p>We're interested in the section for Convert Format.  Go ahead and grab any GIF or JPEG file (preferably small) and use the form
         to upload the image.  Then hit Upload.  If everything worked, you'll instantly see a page with a URL of
         <a href="http://localhost:9000/convert?type=png">http://localhost:9000/convert?type=png</a> and your image displayed in PNG format.  You
         can drag the file over to your Desktop and check it out for yourself (it should be named convert.png).  Nice!
      </p>

      <h2>How do we prep for a front-end?</h2>

        <p>OK, but I want to prepare for being able to call the REST service via URL in a Spring Boot app that I'll be setting up. I can at
          least get a general idea of how this will work by calling the service by URL with the parameters needed.  How could we do this? Well,
          there's the "let's get this tested" way, and then there's thinking about how this will work in production.  First, the actual REST API call.
        </p>

        <p>The documentation for the convert functionality is here: <a href="https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#get--post-convert">https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#get--post-convert</a></p>

        <p>In this case, we're really focused on using the <code>type=png</code> parameter.  But how about how to get the image to convert?</p>
        
        <p>Well, I think this depends on what you're doing.  Here, we're just going to ask for an image, and spit out a conversion.  We're not
           expecting to store the files long-term, but if you are building something where you are doing this as either
           an image conversion service (let's hope not), or you are doing this because you are working with images and need to convert them and store
           them for a service tied to a user's account (either something more elaborate or as simple as converting an image for an avatar), then
           dealing with a storage area is important.  Something like an S3 bucket (locked down!) and mounted as a network volume on the container
           would be a good start, or it may work better to keep them as binary objects in your relational database.
        </p>

        <p>In our case, we want something very temporary for testing.  So, I'll setup a folder on my OS where I can then mount it as a volume
           in the docker container, tell imaginary to mount that directory for use, then I'll just add a file or two in that mounted folder on my
           OS and then run the convert REST API call to convert it the image in there.  First, let's create a docker volume.  I'll create a folder
           in my devops_demo project folder called <code>uploads</code> and then mount the volume on the imaginary container like this:
        </p>

        <code>docker run --rm -v ~/dev/devops_demo/uploads:/mnt/uploads -p 9000:9000 h2non/imaginary -mount /mnt/uploads</code>

        <p>I'm not going to go into crazy detail here, but you can always run an exec on the container now, go to <code>/mnt/uploads</code>,
           then in your OS in a separate terminal copy a GIF of JPEG file into your directory (in my case it's in ~/dev/devops_demo/uploads)
           and then go back into your exec terminal and do an <code>ls</code> and confirm that the file you copied in is indeed there.
        </p>

        <p>Once you do (I added a file called <code>0.jpeg</code>), let's run a curl command in your terminal on your OS to simulate a REST
           API call and see what happens:</p>

        <code>curl --output ~/dev/devops_demo/uploads/convert.png -O http://localhost:9000/convert?type=png&file=0.jpeg</code>

        <p>And out pops a convert.png file in your uploads folder on your OS.  Don't believe me that it's a PNG?  Just open the file in Preview
           and launch the inspector and confirm that the Document Type is indeed a PNG image.  Excellent!   Now, this gets us a file, but for
           the actual application, the output would just be piped to the browser as-is without saving.  It would certainly be up to you in your
           Spring Boot app to save the output to a storage location (S3 bucket or binary blob in a DB).
        </p>
