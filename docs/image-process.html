    <h1>Image Processing Docker container</h1>
      <p>OK, I picked image processing as an example solely because it was something that most likely you may do a tiny bit
         of (uploading and changing an avatar, for example) but generally don't want to spin your wheels building something
         on your own when you have a ton of other things to do.  So, I'm pulling from a docker image someone already
         created that handles image processing: h2non's imaginary Docker image and microservice.  You can find documentation
         here on getting the Docker image: <a href="https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#docker">https://github.com/h2non/imaginary#docker</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Yes, this container is utterly overkill for what we need, but it's simple and fast, and this is a throw-away project anyway, right?</p>

      <p>Open your terminal and run this command:</p>
        <code>
          docker pull h2non/imaginary
        </code>

      <p>Before we start the container, we're just going to leave everything default, which means, according to the documentation, port 9000
         on localhost is where the service will be, and imaginary also exposes a form at http://localhost:9000/form if you want to start
         messing around with what imaginary can do, so that's what we'll start with.  Later on, we'll build our own form in Spring Boot
         to post REST calls to imaginary's service so that we can get the results that way.  To start the container:
      </p>
        <code>
          docker run -p 9000:9000 h2non/imaginary
        </code>

      <p>If you don't add the <code>-p 9000:9000</code>, the port in the container will be open to listening, but your OS will not Open
         port 9000 to send traffic to the listening port on the container. Running the <code>docker run</code> command will leave an open
         process in your terminal - just keep it like that for now, then open up a browser and head to <a href="http://localhost:9000/form">http://localhost:9000/form</a>.
         The form should appear and look like this:</p>
