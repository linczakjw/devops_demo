    <h1>Spring Boot application front-end setup</h1>
      <p>OK, so we've setup the basic image processing container and services, so now it's time to write our own front-end to upload the file
        you want to convert into the browser and send it to the service so that it can be converted to a PNG and deliver it back to the user in
        their browser.
      </p>

      <p>To do this, the plan of attack is to create a Spring Boot application for uploading files, containerize it, then allow the two
        containers (the imaginary image service container) and the Spring Boot container to talk to each other.  Now, I'm not a Spring Boot
        developer, and there are examples of how to setup Spring Boot on Spring's website, so I'm not going to regurgitate that here.  Why
        Spring Boot?  Truth be told - I'm not a fan of Java, but it's a challenge for me to do something different, especially when I have
        developed in the past I've used either LAMP or .NET stacks.  So let's challenge ourselves, no?
      </p>

      <h2>Building the Upload Application</h2>
        <p>Let's start with initializing a project.  I'll do it on Spring's Initializer website, but I can do this in VS code as well. Head to
          <a href="https://start.spring.io">https://start.spring.io</a> and fill out the necessary details.  I'll be using Maven. I'm calling
          my group com.devopsdemo with a demo as the name and artifact.  I'm going to use Java 11 and package things as a <code>.jar</code> file.
          The rest I will leave as default. I will add the following dependencies:</p>
          
        <ul>
          <li>Spring Web - this allows us to setup and call RESTful services</li>
          <li>Thymeleaf - a templating engine for making HTML pages</li>
        </ul>
          
        <p>Once I hit Generate, then I'll grab the demo.zip file and unpack it in my ~/dev/devops_demo/folder.
        </p>
